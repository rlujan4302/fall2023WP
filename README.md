Web Programming
Roberto repositories 
 
My name is Roberto Lujan, and my experience with programming started in highschoool. I took web programming, game design, and basic java in high school. In college I took the mandatory cps class such as 1, 2, and 3. I have also taken Assembly language and other elective classes such as this one. I have worked on some small programs such as robotics club programming as well as some simple websites for internships, and rudimentary games. 
I see myself as pretty adept in learning new languages in a bell curve in which I might start slow but I pick things up fast. I have experience with css and html from my highschool classes and my internship. I will probably struggle the most with type script as I had not used that yet and have only just begun learning the basic despite its similarites to normal java script.
I have developed a rather disdain for this field (Looking for something more outside friendly) and am only taking it for the potential future paycheck. I do not imagine spending my entire life coding hopefully. Thank you for your time and I hope to have a great semester together.
